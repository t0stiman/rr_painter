# Painter

This is a prototype mod for Railroader that allows you to apply custom paint jobs AKA skins to rolling stock.  
The mod is not ready for release yet and is only intended for mod developers for now. Mostly because the UV maps of the rolling stock are terrible.

## How to use

Requires [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/).

1. Clone this repository and build the mod.
2. Make sure the mod ended up at `Railroader\Mods\painter`;
3. The `sample_skin` folder is an example of how to create paint jobs. Copy it to `Railroader\Mods\`.
4. Start the game and your locomotives should look something like this:
